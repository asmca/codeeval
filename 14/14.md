String Permutations

Challenge Description:

Write a program to print out all the permutations of a string in alphabetical order. We consider that digits < upper case letters < lower case letters. The sorting should be performed in ascending order.

Input sample:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a file containing an input string, one per line. E.g.

hat

abc

Zu6

Output sample:

Print to stdout, permutations of the string, comma separated, in alphabetical order. E.g.

aht,ath,hat,hta,tah,tha

abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba

6Zu,6uZ,Z6u,Zu6,u6Z,uZ6
